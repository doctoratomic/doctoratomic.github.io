## Hi I'm Matt Costa

After spending a few years in the video production industry, I decided to make a move into web development. As both my values, and my experience being out in the real world taught me much.

## My Mission

My goal is to become a clever JavaScript and Python developer. And hopefully by gaining enough skill in those languages, I may be able to transition better in languages like Java, Rust, Objective-C, etc.

## Hobbies

- ***Gaming***: Gaming with my friends has been an integral part of my social life. And a part of my interest in programming has stemmed from my experiences with soft mods of classic video games like Doom and Quake.

- ***Movies***: I enjoy an incredibly wide range of films. From classic seventies kung fu, to the silent comedies of the 1920s. Before I decided to become a developer, I had a passion for filmmaking.

- ***Beer***: I'm a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to local craft brews. Particularly lagers, but I am pretty much open to try anything once. Domestic brews usually don't have the depth I'm looking for.

- ***Writing***: I was previously an A+ English student throughout college and high school.
