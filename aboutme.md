## Hi I'm Matt Costa

I got into computers around the time after I walked away from the video production industry. Repairing and flipping "broken computers" was hobby that kind of turned into a career for me.

I have been building websites with Wordpress for over 7 years, and I plan to master the Python programming language. Data science is fascinating to me, and being able to use computers to meticulously measure data as fast as possible is cool and I look forward to learning the process!
