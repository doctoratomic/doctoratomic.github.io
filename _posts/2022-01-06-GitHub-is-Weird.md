## GitHub has been nothing but a hassle for me

This next post is to make sure that I have this correct when editing my new and improved coding blog!

While I am going through review of basic web dev stuff, I've never heard much of Ruby or Markdown. But as a tool it's really cool to be able to generate simple web pages this way.

Keeping my fingers crossed this post will show up on GitHub!
